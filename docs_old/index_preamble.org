#+TITLE: Direct Convolution Package

This package goal is to compute convolution products 

\begin{equation*}
\gamma[k]=\sum\limits_{i\in\Omega^\alpha}\alpha[i]\beta[k+\lambda i],\text{ with }\lambda\in\mathbb{Z}^*
\end{equation*}

using direct (no FFT) methods. This can be helpful for short filters.

*Note:* as it uses a CSS theme this doc is more pleasant to read if you browse it locally:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/vincent-picaud/DirectConvolution.jl.git
firefox DirectConvolution.jl/docs/index.html
#+END_SRC

*Caveat:* this package is still in early development... For
documentation it uses =J4Org.jl=, a package I am currently developing
to document code using Emacs Org-mode.

This package is based on my old posts:
